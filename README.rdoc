== SETUP

1. Navigate to the project's root directory
2. Terminal: rake db:create
3. Terminal: rake db:migrate
4. Terminal: rake db:seed
5. Terminal: rails server
6. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/ to begin

Note: sending emails should work without any configuration. For convenience, I left SMTP credentials of a test gmail account hard coded in development.rb.
